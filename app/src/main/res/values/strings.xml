    <string name="no_active_boosts_title">No active boosts for this station at the moment</string>
    <string name="no_active_boosts_desc">More reward boosts coming soon.</string>
    <string name="daily_reward_explanation">WeatherXM’s goal is to become an open, decentralized ecosystem structured in such a way that network growth, and thereby balanced global weather coverage, is incentivised and every participant (weather station owners and service providers) is fairly and organically rewarded in accordance to the value they contribute to the network.\n\nStation owners are responsible for deploying and maintaining their stations and ensuring the best possible quality of weather data following the Network’s guidelines of deployment. In return, they are rewarded in the Network’s token, called $WXM.\n\nEvery day, our reward algorithm assesses the performance of all weather stations, calculates the Base Reward and any additional rewards originating from various active “Boosts”, and allocates the total reward amount to each user’s connected wallet.\n\nRead more about how our Reward Mechanism works.</string>
    <string name="data_quality_explanation">The Network is as good as its data and we need our data to be meaningful and usable. The Data Quality score is the quantification of this metric. The end goal is to encourage weather station owners to do their best to comply with the Network’s guidelines in order to consistently achieve the best data quality possible.\n\nA weather station’s daily reward is affected by its Data Quality score. To calculate the Data Quality score, we have created an open source algorithm that evaluates the quality of the weather data using various methods. The calculated score indicates the confidence level in the quality of the weather data received from the station.\n\nRead more about how our Quality-of-Data algorithm works.</string>
    <string name="location_quality_explanation">It is important for the Network that a station remains at the same location throughout its lifetime.\n\nThe Proof-of-Location algorithm evaluates location data associated with the station, their accuracy, and consistency. It generates a score which is a confidence indicator about the station’s location.\n\nRead more about how our Proof-of-Location algorithm works.</string>
    <string name="cell_ranking_explanation">Cell ranking is a measure of a station’s performance relative to others within the same cell - a hexagonal area, covering approximately 5 square kilometers (2 square miles) on the planet.\n\nCell capacity is a parameter that is used to define the maximum number of stations that are eligible for rewards in a specific cell. Every cell has a predefined capacity that depends on its geospatial characteristics*.\n\nEvery station is ranked in its cell daily, based on its reward score and its seniority. As long as the station’s ranking is above the capacity threshold, it will be rewarded, whereas getting below it will lead to zero rewards. For example, in a cell with a max capacity of 5 stations, if a station is ranked 3rd it will get rewarded, but if it is ranked 7th, it won’t receive any rewards.\n\nRead more about how our Cell Capacity algorithm works.\n\n* The cell capacity is currently set to the fixed value of 10 rewardable stations, for every cell.</string>

Every cell has a predefined capacity that depends on its geospatial characteristics*.\n\nEvery station is ranked in its cell daily, based on its reward score and its seniority. As long as the station’s ranking is above the capacity threshold, it will be rewarded, whereas getting below it will lead to zero rewards. For example, in a cell with a max capacity of 5 stations, if a station is ranked 3rd it will get rewarded, but if it is ranked 7th, it won’t receive any rewards.\n\nRead more about how our Cell Capacity algorithm works.\n\n* The cell capacity is currently set to the fixed value of 10 rewardable stations, for every cell.</string>

The Android app powering the people's weather network.

## Building

To build the app from source, you need to pass the following environment variables, 
through `gradle` command line arguments, or by creating a `.env` properties file
in the root directory, according to the [template](.env.template) file,
that will be automatically read into env variables by the build script.
